# cp-gov-uk-notify-gateway

Spring Boot (Modern by Default) service that dispatches outbound notifications — email and letter — on
behalf of CPP contexts. It is the re-platform of the legacy WildFly `cpp-context-notification-notify`.

## What it does

- **Consumes** `send-*-notification` commands from an Azure Service Bus queue (no REST command API).
- **Sends email** via GOV.UK Notify, routing to **Office 365** for large (>2MB) or `cjsm.net`
  attachments; sends **letters** via GOV.UK Notify's precompiled-letter API.
- **Fetches attachments** from Azure Blob Storage by `fileUri` (BYO filestore).
- **Persists** each notification (Postgres/Flyway) and runs send/retry/status-polling on
  **cp-task-manager**.
- **Publishes the outcome** (sent / failed / bounced) to the queue named in the inbound message's
  `ReplyTo` property — per-originator, and only when `ReplyTo` is present (otherwise fire-and-forget).
- **Exposes a read/query API** over the notification store.
