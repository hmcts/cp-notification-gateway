## Legacy parity principle (standing rule)

Every story that implements **business logic** ported from `cpp-context-notification-notify` MUST
maintain **behavioural parity** with the legacy service (NFR-001) — same inbound/outbound contracts,
same email/letter/bounce/POCA semantics, same retry/poll timings and failure classification. Where a
field or behaviour originates in the legacy code, the story cites the legacy source and pins parity in
an AC or DoD item (e.g. NG-S02/AC-013 retry list byte-for-byte; NG-S03/AC-016 golden-master payload
with capture-at-send/carry-in-envelope field sourcing; NG-S11 `FailureSelector` taxonomy). Any
**intentional deviation** from legacy (e.g. NG-S12's recover-by-reference guard, which legacy lacks)
MUST be called out explicitly and backed by an ADR. Pure infrastructure/enabler stories (CI,
identity/RBAC, provisioning, deploy — NG-S05/07/08/09) carry no behavioural-parity obligation.

## FR → Story → AC mapping

| FR | Requirement (short) | Story | AC IDs covered | Notes |
|----|---|---|---|---|
| FR-001 | Scaffold service from HMCTS template | [NG-S01](./NG-S01.md) | (no dedicated AC) | Bundled with FR-002 — enabler |
| FR-002 | Flyway `notification` + co-located `jobs` table | [NG-S01](./NG-S01.md) | AC-001, AC-001a | |
| FR-003 | Listen & orchestrate command ingestion (dedupe, atomic INSERT+enqueue, ack after commit) | [NG-S02](./NG-S02.md) | AC-002, AC-003, AC-004, AC-005, AC-006, AC-007, AC-008 | Bundled with FR-004/005/006 — inseparable layers of "one complete send" |
| FR-004 | Attachment download from Azure Blob | [NG-S02](./NG-S02.md) | AC-009, AC-010 | |
| FR-005 | Gov.UK Notify send + status poll | [NG-S02](./NG-S02.md) | AC-011, AC-012 | |
| FR-006 | cp-task-manager retry/poll timings preserved | [NG-S02](./NG-S02.md) | AC-013 | |
| FR-007 | ReplyTo-gated result publish | [NG-S03](./NG-S03.md) | AC-014, AC-015 | Split from core send — separable value, independently testable via synthetic `ReplyTo` message |
| FR-008 | Result-event contract parity (golden master) | [NG-S03](./NG-S03.md) | AC-016 | |
| FR-009 | Query API returns all columns | [NG-S04](./NG-S04.md) | AC-017, AC-018 | Read API only; auth sliced to NG-S14 (see FR-024 row) |
| FR-010 | Integration test harness (Testcontainers/ASB emulator/Azurite/WireMock/Awaitility) | *(no dedicated story — folded into DoD, per coordinator decision)* | AC-019 | **Covered via DoD across [NG-S02](./NG-S02.md) (happy path, atomicity, blob 403/404), [NG-S03](./NG-S03.md) (result-queue message), [NG-S10](./NG-S10.md) (O365 stub), [NG-S11](./NG-S11.md) (retry), [NG-S12](./NG-S12.md) (redelivery/idempotency)** — not orphaned |
| FR-011 | CI validation pipeline (GitHub Actions) | [NG-S05](./NG-S05.md) | AC-020 | |
| FR-012 | STE simulator/stub routing (Gov.Notify + O365) | [NG-S06](./NG-S06.md) | AC-021 | |
| FR-013 | Managed-identity RBAC for ASB (application code) | [NG-S07](./NG-S07.md) | AC-022, AC-023 | Split from FR-014/015 — `svc` repo vs. infra repos |
| FR-014 | Per-context identity + RBAC (Blob, Key Vault, ASB) | [NG-S08](./NG-S08.md) | AC-024 | Bundled with FR-015 — RBAC needs the namespace to exist |
| FR-015 | ASB namespace/queue provisioning + role assignments | [NG-S08](./NG-S08.md) | AC-025 | |
| FR-016 | Postgres database/schema provisioning | [NG-S09](./NG-S09.md) | (no dedicated AC) | Bundled with FR-017 — deploy needs the DB first |
| FR-017 | Flux CD GitOps deployment | [NG-S09](./NG-S09.md) | AC-026 | |
| FR-018 | SenderFactory routing (cjsm.net / >2MB → O365) | [NG-S10](./NG-S10.md) | AC-027, AC-028, AC-029 | Bundled with FR-019 — routing with no working sender behind it has no value |
| FR-019 | Office 365 immediate-delivery send | [NG-S10](./NG-S10.md) | AC-030 | |
| FR-020 | Failure handling: retry, permanent failure, DLQ | [NG-S11](./NG-S11.md) | AC-031, AC-032, AC-033 | Distinct from FR-022 — bounds *how long* retries continue |
| FR-021 | *(removed by Stage 2 — dual-write atomicity resolved by co-located transaction; no reconciliation sweep needed)* | — | — | Not carried into Stage 3 |
| FR-022 | At-least-once safety: state guard + Gov.Notify recover-by-reference | [NG-S12](./NG-S12.md) | AC-035, AC-036 | Distinct from FR-020 — prevents *double-acting* on retries |
| FR-023 | Observability: logs, metrics, DLQ-depth | [NG-S13](./NG-S13.md) | AC-037, AC-038 | |
| FR-024 | Secure query API with IDAM auth | [NG-S14](./NG-S14.md) | AC-039 | Sliced out of NG-S04 — auth pattern is an open ADR (Pattern 1 vs Pattern 2, see `pending/query-api-authentication.md`) |

**Coverage check:** every FR-001…FR-024 (FR-021 removed by Stage 2) lands in exactly one story.
Every AC-001…AC-039 in `requirements.md` (AC-034 does not exist — no FR/AC gap, just an unused number)
lands in exactly one story or is explicitly covered via DoD (FR-010/AC-019). No orphaned FR or AC.
FR-009 and FR-024, previously bundled together in a single NG-S04, are now split across NG-S04
(FR-009/AC-017/AC-018, the read API) and NG-S14 (FR-024/AC-039, its auth) — the re-slice does not
orphan either FR or AC.

Note on FR-010: the integration-test-harness FR has no dedicated story in this backlog — per the
coordinator's Q1 decision its scenarios are folded into the DoD of NG-S02, NG-S03, NG-S10, NG-S11,
NG-S12 (see mapping table above).

## ADR flags raised in this pass
- **NG-S01**: *"Direct-to-DB + cp-task-manager replaces CQRS/Event-Sourcing for notification-notify"*
  (Stage 2 recommendation #1, pattern departure from the legacy context).
- **NG-S12**: *"Idempotent send via Gov.UK Notify recover-by-reference"* (Stage 2 recommendation #2,
  FR-022 duplicate-send prevention without a sweep/outbox).
- **NG-S14**: query-API authentication pattern — Pattern 1 (`cp-auth-rules-filter` header-trust,
  network-boundary security, no in-service token validation) vs. Pattern 2 (Spring Security OAuth2
  resource server against Entra ID, genuine cryptographic JWT validation, the sanctioned
  `cpp-mbd-notification-svc-pilot` blueprint). Genuinely open — no platform-sanctioned winner; full
  analysis in `docs/pipeline/pending/query-api-authentication.md`. An ADR is required before
  implementation begins.

## Open / blocked items

- **Data retention period (NFR-014, UK-GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018) — stage-gating, must be
  resolved before go-live.** `requirements.md` NFR-014 requires the `notification` table's retention
  period to be "defined and enforced" but no value is given, and no FR in this backlog enforces a
  purge/retention mechanism. Stage 2's Handoff Gap Report (Gap #4) explicitly defers enforcement and
  routes this to product/DPO rather than inventing a period. **No story or ticket is created for this
  in Stage 3** — per the coordinator's Q3 decision, this is recorded here as a single open-item line
  only. Once product/DPO set the retention period, amend `requirements.md` NFR-014 with the agreed
  value, and a new story (with a real AC, e.g. a scheduled purge job) should be raised at that point —
  the current schema does not preclude this (indexed `created_at`).
- **cp-task-manager stale-lock recovery gap (OQ-4)** — upstream library gap (no reaper for jobs whose
  worker crashed mid-execution); documented in full in `cp-task-manager-stale-lock-gap.md` and
  referenced as a risk note inside [NG-S12](./NG-S12.md). **No story or ticket is created for this in
  this backlog** — it belongs to the cp-task-manager library/repo, per the explicit carry-forward
  instruction from Stage 2.
- **OQ-1 (ASO capability for ASB CRDs)** — Platform-owned, referenced inside [NG-S08](./NG-S08.md);
  decides the provisioning *mechanism* only, not the RBAC outcome described in that story's ACs.
- **OQ-2 (ACR pull / App Insights identity) and OQ-3 (`sadevcommonscsl` shared storage account)** —
  Platform-owned, carried as assumptions per `requirements.md`; not attached to any specific story.

## Handoff to Test Specs (Stage 4)

Inputs the test-engineer stage must read (explicit paths — Stage 4 reads only what is listed here):
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/_index.md` (this file — FR→Story→AC mapping, open/blocked items, ADR flags)
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S01.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S02.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S03.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S04.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S05.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S06.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S07.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S08.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S09.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S10.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S11.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S12.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S13.md`
- `docs/pipeline/user-stories/NG-S14.md`
- `docs/pipeline/requirements.md` (governing FRs/ACs/NFRs, referenced by ID from the stories above)
- `docs/pipeline/legacy-result-event-contract.md` (golden-master detail underlying NG-S03's ACs)

**Carry-forwards for Stage 4 to honour:**
- FR-010/AC-019 has no dedicated story — its five sub-scenarios are Definition-of-Done items inside
  NG-S02/NG-S03/NG-S10/NG-S11/NG-S12; Stage 4 should write test specs against those DoD items directly,
  not look for a standalone "harness" story.
- All 14 stories have Jira tickets (NG-S01→PEG-3372, S02→PEG-3373, S03→PEG-3382,
  S04→PEG-3383 [scope narrowed to FR-009 only after the NG-S14 slice; description resynced],
  S05→PEG-3384, S06→PEG-3390, S07→PEG-3391, S08→PEG-3385, S09→PEG-3392, S10→PEG-3386, S11→PEG-3387,
  S12→PEG-3388, S13→PEG-3389, S14→PEG-3410 [sliced out of NG-S04, relates to PEG-3383]), all under
  epic PEG-3350 with labels `claude-generated`/`needs-review`. Test-spec authoring may reference either
  the story IDs or the Jira keys. Tickets hold ACs + Out-of-scope only — the `.md` files remain the
  full-detail source of truth.
- OQ-4 (cp-task-manager stale-lock gap) is a risk note inside NG-S12 only — do not write a test spec
  attempting to verify a fix for it; it is out of this service's control.
- The data-retention open item has no AC — do not invent one; it stays untested until product/DPO
  resolve it and a real story/AC is raised.

**This is the Stage 3 human gate. Halting here — do not proceed to test-engineer (Stage 4) until the
user confirms these 14 stories are approved.** NG-S14's Jira ticket
([PEG-3410](https://tools.hmcts.net/jira/browse/PEG-3410)) has been created under epic PEG-3350.
